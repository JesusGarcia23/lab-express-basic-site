            <h2>What is a Bonsai?</h2>
            <p>Bonsai is a very old art. And although we commonly think of it as Japanese it originated in China. But the Japanese definitely raised it to the art we now know it as.
                The art of Bonsai began in China. And it is known by several different words. The word "pen-jing" covers all of the art of bonsai.
                 And there are two other important words, "pun-sai" which means a tree planted in a container without any landscaping.
                 And "pun-ching" which means a tree that is planted in a container along with a landscape.

            <h2>Type of Bonsais</h2>
            <p>There are several different types of bonsai trees, and the ones you choose will depend on where you live,
                 the space you have to work with, and the style or vision you have for your masterpiece. </p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>If you live in a colder climate or an area with harsh winters, it may be best for you to grow a tree that is suited for the indoors. </li>
                     <li>If you are located in a tropical climate, you may want to avoid northern species that are used to dormant periods and seasonal changes. </li>

                 </ul>

                 <p>Some types of bonsai trees can adapt to a variety of conditions, while others are very sensitive,
                      so it is important that you investigate the needs of each option before making a purchase.</p>

                <p>Basically, bonsai trees are divided into two categories: indoor and outdoor. Those species best suited for the indoors do not handle the elements well and must be kept in an environment where they are protected from harsh weather conditions.
                     Other types of bonsai trees are quite hardy and are ideal for outdoor bonsai, often allowing for larger varieties and bigger shapes.</p>

<h3>Indoor Bonsai</h3>
<p>Indoor bonsai is typically more difficult to care for, so it is important that you choose a tree that will be comfortable in your home environment. </p>
<p>Houseplants are a great choice for bonsai, but if you wish to use a more traditional tree, try to find one that has similar care instructions to other thriving plants in your house.
     Or, be prepared to change the climatic conditions of your home to make it more suitable. </p>
<p>Tropical or subtropical trees are the best choice since they are the easiest to grow indoors.
Some good options would include Hawaiian umbrella tree, Sago Palms, Serissa, Fulkien Tea, Schefflera, Aralias, Money Trees, Brush Cherry, Bougainvillea, Gardenias, Ficus, Baby Jade, Cotoneaster, and some types of elms.</p>

<h3>Outdoor Bonsai</h3>
<p>Outdoor bonsai is divided into two categories â€“ coniferous (evergreen) or deciduous.</p>
<p>Coniferous trees are a common choice since they keep their foliage all year round.
Perhaps the most popular and well-known bonsai is the juniper, which is very hardy and easy to grow. Other examples would include pine tree varieties, boxwood, and azaleas. </p>

<p>Deciduous trees will lose their leaves in the fall and enter a dormant period.
Some artists enjoy this feature, with the bare branches of winter offering a stark contrast to the lush spring or summer flowers and foliage.
Some ideal deciduous choices include maples, elms, gingko, larch, crab apple, hornbeam, and bald cypress.</p>
