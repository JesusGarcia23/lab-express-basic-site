            <h2>What is a Bonsai?</h2>
            <p>Bonsai is a very old art. And although we commonly think of it as Japanese it originated in China. But the Japanese definitely raised it to the art we now know it as.
                The art of Bonsai began in China. And it is known by several different words. The word "pen-jing" covers all of the art of bonsai.
                 And there are two other important words, "pun-sai" which means a tree planted in a container without any landscaping.
                 And "pun-ching" which means a tree that is planted in a container along with a landscape.
